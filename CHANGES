    * Fix wrong label in balls and urns table. In the first row, both balls and
      urns should be distinguishable. (Mathieu Bruyen)

    * Fix \begin{center} typo. (Mathieu Bruyen)

    * Address a couple of issues pointed out by Michael Turmon:

      - Fix wrong label of the F distribution plot.
      - In §5, sum of variances: demote invalid equivalence to an implication.
      - Fix incorrect abbreviation of the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN).
      - Remove unnecessary finite variance restriction in LLN.

    * Fix variance of Student's t distribution. (Haomin Liao and Vincent Yang)


2012-07-03  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Create ggplot2 version of the distribution plots. The new plots work
      better with black-and-white printing since they:

        1) use a dark Brewer color palette (more contrast)
        2) use different line types
        3) have an increased line width

    * Let Make pre-generate the distribution plots and remove them from the
      repository. Building the cookbook now requires and recent R installation
      and the following packages:

        - ggplot2
        - reshape
        - grid
        - MCMCpack
        - VGAM

    * Fix typo in chi-square PDF. (Steve Cheng-Xian Li)


2011-10-25  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fix variable naming in Negative Binomial distribution. (Marcial)


2011-07-20  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Provide language template for translation. Please see

        https://github.com/mavam/probstat-translations

      for details.

    * Clean up wording in the process of creating language template.

    * Consistent use of \widehat and \hat.

    * Consistent capitalization.

    * Remove 1-alpha description in Bayesian credible intervals.

    * Fix a few spelling mistakes.


2011-07-02  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add missing parenthesis in result of infinite series kp^(k-1). (masonium)


2011-03-06  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Use \displaystyle for Gamma functions.

    * Move footnote about Gamma/Beta functions to first table.

    * Tweak distribution graphs: reduce margin and tick marks size.  (Colin
      Gillespie)

    * Fix title of InverseGamma distribution plot.


2011-03-05  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add Student's t and F distribution. (Colin Gillespie)

    * Add extra column with notation/abbreviation of distribution. (Colin
      Gillespie)

    * Use LaTeX booktabs package for distribution tables. (Colin Gillespie)

    * Move properties of Gamma and Beta functions from the section Distribution
      Relationships into the Math section.

    * Fix headings for finite and binomial series.


2011-02-23  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fixed wrong exponent in the MGF of the multinomial distribution. (Daniel
      Nolan)

    * In section 3, remove f_X(x) in the PDF equation. (Daniel Nolan)


2011-02-18  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fixed a subtle error in the section Probability Theory. The continuity of
      probabilities property now stands by itself. (Daniel Nolan)


2011-01-10  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fix a wrong index in the finite series involving odd natural numbers
      (Daniel Nolan).

    * Unify indices of finite series to start at 1 where the first index
      yields a vacuous term.

    * Add a few basic identities involving binomial coefficients.


2011-01-04  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Fix error in the Dirichlet density: the numerator and denominator of the
      Dirichlet density function was flipped. (Rui Li)


2010-12-18  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add a section about basic concepts in spectral analysis of time series.


2010-12-10  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * In the section Maximum Likelihood, the numerator and denominator of the
      asymptotic relative efficiency was flipped. (Jason He)

    * In the section Point Estimation, the MSE did not include the squared
      bias. (Jason He)


2010-12-01  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add a table describing the behavior of the ACF and PACF for causal and
      invertible ARMA models.

    * Remov the discussion about orthogonal functions in the math section.


2010-11-20  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Augment the distribution tables with plots of that visualize the PMFs and
      PDFs of the major distributions.


2010-11-19  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * New section Sampling Methods, currently includes the boostrap, rejection
      sampling, and importance sampling.

    * More conjugate priors for the univariate Gaussian likelihood when the
      mean is known and when both mean and variance are unknown.

    * Split distribution table in two tables for discrete and continuous
      distributions.

    * New distribution functions: Multinomial, Dirichlet, Weibull, Multivariate
      Gaussian, Log-normal, Pareto, Chi-square.

    * Fix log-likelihood symbol (replaced with \ell)


2010-10-09  Matthias Vallentin  <vallentin@icir.org>

    * Add two conjugate prior tables for discrete and continuous likelihood
      distributions, including both prior and posterior hyperparameters.
